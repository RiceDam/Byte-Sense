            Byte Sense was formed with one mission in mind - to provide the
            world with a safer place in the cyberspace. We provide customers
            with our new Cybersecurity Antivirus protection which is more
            diverse. The product can thoroughly scan all computer systems and
            server infrastructures as it hunts down any foreign IP addresses,
            MAC addresses, usernames, geographic locations, current
            installations, and removal of packages and applications within the
            system. We also offer our Cybersecurity professional services to
            help companies with server remediations, malicious monitoring,
            upgrades of computer systems, and custom-built applications.
